modmore documentation
=====================

This repository contains the Markdown source for the modmore documentation. Eventually this will live at docs.modmore.com and will be the canonical place for documentation on all modmore extras.

Contributions to this documentation are very welcome!

## Folder Structure

This repository has a fairly deep folder structure. This is because we'd like to eventually add different languages and version specific documentation, even if those aren't available here now.

The basic structure is:

`/Language/Topic/v{Major Version}.x/Documentation.md`

The documentation can be further split up. This will be shown on the documentation website in a tree view. 

For example `/en/ContentBlocks/v1.x/Fields.md` or `/ru/Commerce/v0.x/Modules/EUVat.md`. 

## File Format

Every document starts with a simple annotation 

## Contributing

You're invited to help us improve the documentation. For this we use git and pull requests on github to manage changes. If you're new to git and need a bit more help getting set up, don't hesitate to ask for help. 

When suggesting content changes, please limit yourself to one topic (extra) per pull request. For typos a single pull request across the entire repository is fine.

## Previewing changes

When writing this, we haven't finished setting up docs.modmore.com so we don't have guidelines yet on how to test/preview changes. If you stick to standard markdown, everything should look good.
