The EU Vat Module is shipped with the Commerce core. It needs to be enabled before use via Configuration > Modules. 

The EU VAT Module is used to apply the standard VAT rate for the customer's country to all items in the cart. It retrieves the current VAT rates from [euvatrates.com](https://euvatrates.com/) and caches them for 3 days. 

The module does not currently validate or apply different rules depending on the customers' VAT registration number, if provided, but that's something that we intend to add before the beta release.
