Added in Commerce 0.3, the TaxJar module provides an integration with the [TaxJar SmartCalcs API](https://www.taxjar.com/smartcalcs/) for fully automated and highly accurate US Sales Tax calculations. 

TaxJar requires a subscription starting at $19 USD per month. In return, you don't have to worry about figuring out appropriate destination and sender based sales tax rates. 

## Properties

- **TaxJar API Token**: this is provided by TaxJar under [Account > SmartCalcs API](https://app.taxjar.com/account#api-access). 
- **Nexus State**: the state from where you sell or ship your products. 
- **Nexus Zip**: the zipcode from where you sell or ship your products.

If you have more than one Nexus, you can [add those to your TaxJar account](https://app.taxjar.com/account#api-access) and they'll be taken into consideration as well.
