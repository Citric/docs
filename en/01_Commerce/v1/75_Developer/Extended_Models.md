By extending the xPDO models, and creating new objects with your specified `class_key`, you can override some specific behaviour. For example you may [extend the shipping method object](Custom_Shipping_Methods) to implement dynamic pricing through a shipping partners' API, or [add a new page to the merchant dashboard](Example_Modules/Add_Backend_Page).
