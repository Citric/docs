The EUVat Module is shipped with the Commerce core. It needs to be enabled and configured before use via Configuration > Modules. 

The EU VAT Module is used to apply the standard VAT rate for the customer's country to all items in the cart. It retrieves the current VAT rates from euvatrates.com and caches them for 3 days.
