Congratulations on your Commerce-powered online store! This user guide will guide you through what you can do with the Commerce software. 

It's important to note that your developer, designer or web agency, may have changed the way things look or work. If you're unsure about anything, be sure to ask your contact. 


**As Commerce is still in development, the user guide is not ready yet.** [A list of planned topics can be found here.](https://github.com/modmore/docs/issues/19)
