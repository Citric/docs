description: Documentation for Commerce, a premium extra from modmore for MODX. 
---

[Commerce](https://www.modmore.com/commerce/) brings a flexible and easy to use e-commerce solution to MODX.

**Commerce is currently in ALPHA.** This means it is only available if you've been invited, and that the features and documentation are still fairly basic. With the help of our alpha testers we'll be finishing the version 1.0 features before the beta starts (around February/March). Licenses for production use will not be available until we hit beta.

If you'd like to join the Alpha or Beta, please email support@modmore.com. Keep in mind we already have a fairly long list of people waiting, so you may not get access to Commerce for some time when you only sign up now.
