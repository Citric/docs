One of the discount features in SimpleCart is adding coupon codes with properties to determine what kind of discount the customer will get. This can be found under Extras > SimpleCart > Management.   

Note that discounts are always be applied to the whole cart. For example when you add a 50% discount when someone orders a certain product. The discount will be applied to all goods they order, at least when the required product is added.

## Creating single code

When you hit the "create single" button you can manually add a code.

In the window that appears you have several options. Those are explained below.

- Creation mode: Determine to generate a code automatically or manual
- Code length: The length of the code. Only available in automatic creation mode
- Character includes: Which characters should be included in automatic created codes
- Code: The actual coupon code. Only available when in manual creation mode
- Discount Amount: The fixed amount of the discount applied to the cart
- Discount Percentage: The dynamic percentage discount. It's best to only use a percentage or fixed discount; not both. 
- Max usage: The number of times this code can be used
- From Amount: The total cart amount the code is valid from
- Product Restriction: Whether a certain product should be in the cart to enable the discount
- Expire Date: Date and time the code will be expired

## Creating bulk codes

With the _Create Bulk_ button you can create lots of coupon codes in one go. The options are the same as with creating a single code. 

## Exporting to CSV

The export allows you to download a CSV file with all codes. This is especially useful after creating codes in bulk.
