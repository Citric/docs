It's possible to apply a discount per user or user group. This is done in Extras > SimpleCart > Management on the _User(Group) discounts_ tab. 

This feature is particularly useful if you have a group of resellers or VIP customers that get a discount on the entire catalog. The discount can be either a fixed amount (per cart) or a percentage. 

Click the right button to create a discount either for a user or user group, and fill in the modal. Use the field to search for a user or usergroup, and then set up the additional options as needed. The options are almost the same as for [coupon codes](Coupons).

User and user group discounts can only be applied if the user is logged in.
