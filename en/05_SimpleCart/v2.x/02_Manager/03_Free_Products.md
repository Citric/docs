Via Extras > SimpleCart > Management you can set up products that are automatically given to users for free when they purchase a specific product. 

The _Product to add_ is the free product, while the _Product restriction_ is the product that needs to be in the cart in order to get the free product. With the _From amount_ you can ensure a minimum order total has been reached before adding the free product, and the _Max Usage_ and _Expire date_ limits the offer further.
