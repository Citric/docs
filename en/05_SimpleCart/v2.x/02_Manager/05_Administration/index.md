The administer area of SimpleCart is used for the setting up the shop. This includes setting up [custom order statuses](Order_Statuses), [delivery](Delivery_Methods) and [payment methods](Payment_Methods), as well as the [email configuration](Emails) and more. 

To access the administration area, click the cog icon in the top right of the management component, or go to it directly via Extras > SimpleCart > Administer.
