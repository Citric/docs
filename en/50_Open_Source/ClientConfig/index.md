ClientConfig gives your client a user-friendly interface for making site wide changes, while you as the administrator set up the different options available to the end-user. Settings are available with the familiar `[[++setting]]` tag for super easy implementation, and settings are also available through the `$modx->getOption('key')` APIs, allowing overriding of System Settings.

ClientConfig is maintained on [Github](https://github.com/Mark-H/ClientConfig), please file your bugs and feature request there. Pull requests are welcomed as well! 

The first release was on December 9th, 2012 and is also available from [MODX.com](https://modx.com/extras/package/clientconfig).
